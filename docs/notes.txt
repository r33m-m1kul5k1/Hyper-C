the bug:

when enabling paging back with pae in protected mode the HV crashes.

reasons:
1. I shouldn't load the cr3 register when jumping to protected mode from long mode.
2. Most likely not a format issue.

solutions:
1. to not use pae & paging in protected mode.


the bug:

when returning from the protected_to_real function the ret instruction jumps to 0xcec
it happens without the cpu host

reasons:
1. sti results an interrupt call
2. takes the wrong address from the stack
3. disabling paging the wrong way - not it
4. maybe protected mode must use paging?

the stack address was higher then accessible in real mode :)
